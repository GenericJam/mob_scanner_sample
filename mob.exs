# mob.exs — Mob build configuration. COMMIT THIS FILE: it holds project
# config (which plugins are activated, which plugin signing keys are trusted).
# The generator used to gitignore it; a clone without it activates no plugins,
# and every plugin call then fails at runtime with :nif_not_loaded.
# Machine-local overrides go in mob.local.exs (gitignored), imported below.
#
# OTP runtimes for Android and iOS are downloaded automatically by `mix mob.install`.

import Config

config :mob_dev,
  # Path to the mob library repo (native source files for iOS/Android builds).
  mob_dir: Path.join(File.cwd!(), "deps/mob"),

  # Path to your Elixir lib dir (e.g. ~/.local/share/mise/installs/elixir/1.18.4-otp-28/lib).

# Activated capability plugins (the packages added in mix.exs). Each contributes
# its native code, permissions, and any demo screens at build time. Drop a name
# here to deactivate a plugin without removing the dep; remove both to drop it
# entirely (the native build shrinks and a clean rebuild prunes its artifacts).

# Trust gate for the first-party plugins. Each is signed in CI with the shared
# mob release key; this is that key's public fingerprint. The build refuses an
# ACTIVATED plugin whose signature doesn't verify against a trusted fingerprint
# (tamper protection) — entries for plugins you haven't activated are simply
# unused, so every official plugin is pre-trusted and "just works" the moment
# you add it to deps + :plugins above. For your own/third-party plugins, run
# `mix mob.plugin.trust <name>`, or `config :mob, :acknowledge_unsafe_plugins,
# [...]` for an unsigned prototype.
